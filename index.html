            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mark Giannelli. In 2021, I decided to leave the accounting industry for good and pursue a career path that aligns more with my values. I have a passion for coding, logic and problem solving. I have a thirst for knowledge that will never be quenched no matter how many gatorades I drink. 
            </p>
            <P>
                Currently I'm a student in UT's coding bootcamp. I've never been more challenged and excited at the same time in my life. Currently we studied HTML & CSS, with Javascript on the horizon. This webpage will be an example of all the skills I've developed from this camp. I hope you're as thrilled as me to see how this portfolio evolves over the next 6 months! Enjoy!
            </P>
